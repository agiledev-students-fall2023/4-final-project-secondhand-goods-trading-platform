# Project Repository

## Description of the Project

We propose to build a secondhand goods trading platform targeting college students specifically. College students, who often possess a limited amount of disposable income, are always circumscribed by a humble budget when they are adding school supplies, buying furniture, or making purchases in general. Therefore, we will establish a platform for college students to buy and sell reliable second-hand products with a budget-friendly price tag.

## Product Vision Statement
Empowering college students to buy, sell, and connect effortlessly, ensuring affordability and sustainability at the heart of every exchange.

## History of the project

The concept for this project emerged from personal experiences and observations of college life. We recognized the financial constraints faced by many college students and identified a gap in the market for a dedicated second-hand trading platform. Our team united with the shared vision of making college life more affordable and sustainable, leading to the inception of this project.
