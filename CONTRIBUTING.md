# Concluding Thoughts

When we embarked on our educational journeys in the US, we encountered difficulties in establishing our new lives due to the absence of a seamless platform to facilitate our initial setup. Driven by our experiences and understanding of this unique challenge, we have collaborated to develop a solution tailored for college students navigating similar pathways. Our app endeavors to make buying and selling second-hand goods not only convenient but also a delight, through its thoughtful features and user-friendly functionality. Here’s to happy coding and to making an impact on the lives of other college students!


# The Git workflow

1. Follow the git workflow guide
2. Commits to the project with a pull request
3. Before the changes can be merged into the main branch, the pull request must undergo tests and receive approval from at least one other team member.


# How to Build and Test Project

To be determined … This would be updated as we develop the app further throughout the semester.
